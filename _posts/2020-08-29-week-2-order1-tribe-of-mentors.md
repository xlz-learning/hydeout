After reading more about this book. There are 2 things I've realized.
1. Tribe of Mentors is more like a reference book that gives me advise.
2. Therefore, a lot of the notes and highlights are kind of to myself at the time of the reading. I truly think this book should be one of those books I reread once in a while. Maybe I will have different understandings to some of the stories and recommendations provided in the book than the people reading my blog or each time I reread the book.

I've made 2 decisions.
1. I am not going to include my learning from this book in this blog (starting week 2) since different people (or same person reading it in the future) may find other ideas helpful rather than the ones I noted in this blog.
2. Instead of borrowing this book, I am going to purchase it so I can own it and keeps going back to it once in a while.
