<p>Busy is a decision. If we use busy as an excuse for not doing something what we are really, really saying is that itâ€™s not a priority.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t <em>find</em>  the time to do something; you <em>make</em>  the time to do things.</p>

<p>The problem is this: if you let yourself off the hook for not doing something for any reason, you wonâ€™t ever do it.</p>

<p>Confidence is overrated. Courage was more important than confidence. When you are operating out of courage, you are saying that no matter how you feel about yourself or your opportunities or the outcome, you are going to take a risk and take a step toward what you want. (You are not waiting for the confidence to mysteriously arrive) Confidence is achieved through repeated success at any endeavor. (Confidence happens after you master something not before)</p>

<p>As of career advise, do your best to stay in â€œcareer shapeâ€. Have a point of view, and share it meaningfully, thoughtfully, and with conviction.</p>

<p>If you are looking for work-life balance in your 20s or 30s, you are likely in the wrong career. If you are doing something you love, you donâ€™t want work-life balance.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t acting impulsively. When feeling urge to respond defensively, wait, force yourself to breathe, take a step back, and wait to respond. Just an hour or two or an overnight retreat makes a world of difference.</p>

<p>We only get what we desire most, and to apply myself with a laserlike focus upon a goal, task, or project.</p>

<p>In order to â€œhaveâ€ you must â€œdoâ€â€, and in order to â€œdoâ€ you must â€œbeâ€ â€” and this process is immediate.</p>

<p>YOU TOOK YOUR SHOT. Have the courage to fail on my own terms. If I was going to succeed or fail, it was going to be up to me.</p>

<p>Every great and extraordinary accomplishment in this world was done through courage.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d rather die doing something I feel is great and amazing rather than be safe and comfortable living a life I hate.</p>

<p>The more you run from your fears, the bigger they get, but the more you go into them, the more they they tend to vanish like a mirage.</p>

<p>There is a difference between intelligence and wisdom. Intelligence is like following a GPS route right into a body of water until you drown. Wisdom looks at the route but, when it takes a turn into the ocean, decides not to follow it, then finds a new, better way. Wisdom reigns supreme.</p>

<p>Every mistake I have ever made was because I thought if I didnâ€™t do or get this now, it was never going to happen.</p>

<p>You work hard because youâ€™re inspired to, not because you have to.</p>

<p>Bad relationship (family, friends, business partners etc.) can have huge negative impact to your life. One way to identify bad relationship is to talk to your imaginary great-grandchildren. Ask them about decisions and relationships and whether or not to continue them. They tend to speak loud and clear. â€œGrandpa, you shouldnâ€™t do this, or you need to leave these people alone because we will be affected negatively, or worse, we wonâ€™t exist.â€ One wrong person in your circle can destroy your whole future. Itâ€™s that important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing youâ€™ve got to focus on. But thatâ€™s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. Iâ€™m actually as proud of the things we havenâ€™t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. â€” Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What you seek is seeking you â€” Rumi</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination. â€” Oscar Wilde</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think failure is <em>sometimes</em>  part of the progress â€” it <em>always</em> is</p>

<p>Suffering is the greatest teach Iâ€™ve ever had.</p>

<h2 id="susan-cain">Susan Cain</h2>

<p>Failure sometimes isnâ€™t a bad thing, you can either learn from it or take a time to think about if this is something that I really enjoy doing. Treat failure as a break, all the sudden you have time and space to think about life outside of what you are doing (and probably just failed at doing). Take another look, see if there is a better way to do it, or even think again about if this is something I want to spend majority waking time doing.</p>

<p>I want passion to be a permanent source of pleasure, and never to be associate with financial stress or, more generally, the pressure to achieve.</p>

<p>Find something you love to eat/drink (can be food or beverage you love), eat/drink it to jump-start the mind for focus/creative work. I will train your brain to associate your work with the pleasure of the object.</p>

<h2 id="steven-pressfield">Steven Pressfield</h2>

<p>The goal is to connect with your own self, your own soul, not to worry about your friends â€œbeating you or â€œgetting somewhereâ€ ahead of you. Get out to the real world and start failing.</p>

<p>Who are you really? What do you really want? Get out there and fail and find out</p>

<p>Keep learning and success finally will come. Just like Steve Jobs once said: You canâ€™t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something â€” your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.</p>

<p>Real work and real satisfaction come from the opposite of what the web provides. They come from going deep into something â€” the book youâ€™re writing, the album, the movie (the software âœŒğŸ¼) â€” and staying there for a long, long time.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a good habit to go to the gym, working out is hard and it gives you a feeling of you can do anything. As the author of this chapter said: â€œNothing you face today will be harder than what you just didâ€.</p>

<p>Endings donâ€™t have to be failures, especially when you choose to end a project or shut down a business</p>

<p>Learned to envision the ideal end to any project before I begin it now â€” even the best gigs donâ€™t last forever . Nor should they.</p>

<p>The important thing is to learn from each failure and try not to repeat it .</p>

<p>The more clear I am about what my goals are , the more easily I can say no</p>

<ul>
  <li>Action item: come up with my own list of short term and long terms goals</li>
</ul>

<p>When I take the time to articulate what it is that I hope to achieve , itâ€™s simple to refer to the list and see whether saying yes to an opportunity will take me toward or away from achieving that goal .</p>

<p>What to do when feel overwhelmed or unfocused. Get out the head and into the body, try getting up and go for a walk. (Be physical, go for exercise etc)</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A problem well put is half-solved</p>

<p>Life punishes the vague wish and rewards specific ask</p>

<p>All that stands between you and what you want is a better set of questions</p>

<p>Life shrinks or expands in proportion to oneâ€™s courage</p>

<p>11 questions Tim prepared to the â€œMentorsâ€ he sends the questions to are well curated</p>

<p>Good questions in the wrong order get bad response</p>

<p>Many problems of â€œfocusingâ€ are best solved by defining what to ignore</p>
