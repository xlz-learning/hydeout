I"[<p>After reading more about this book. There are 2 things I’ve realized.</p>
<ol>
  <li>This book is more like a reference book that gives me advise.</li>
  <li>Therefore, a lot of the notes and highlights are kind of personal to myself at the time of the reading. I truly think this book should be one of those books I pick up once in a while to reread. Maybe I will have different understandings to some of the stories and recommendations provided in the book.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve made 2 decisions.</p>
<ol>
  <li>I am not going to include my learning from this book in this blog since different people (or same person in different age) may find some other ideas helpful rather than the ones I noted in this blog.</li>
  <li>Instead of borrowing this book, I am going to purchase it so I can own it and keeps going back to it once in a while</li>
</ol>
